#  Instructions
# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people,
# with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
# Thus everyone's share of the total bill 
# is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number.
# You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
